# EventLogger
This program takes JSON file as an input and logs events to database flagging any event that takes more than 4ms 

## Task Description 
Custom-build server logs different events to a file named logfile.txt. Every event has 2 entries in the file - one
entry when the event was started and another when the event was finished. The entries in the file have no specific
order (a finish event could occur before a start event for a given id)
Every line in the file is a JSON object containing the following event data: 
* id - the unique event identifier
* state - whether the event was started or finished (can have values "STARTED" or "FINISHED"
* timestamp - the timestamp of the event in milliseconds
Application Server logs also have the following additional attributes:
* type - type of log
* host - hostname
